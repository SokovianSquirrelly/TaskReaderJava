# Overview

The purpose for me to create this program was to help me learn Java language.  What I wrote is a program to create, modify, and display to-do lists and help someone prioritize the things they have to do.  This is done using .txt files and parsing each line which should have a "priority number" and the task itself.

One of the reasons a program like this is appealing to me is because when I have a lot of things to do, it helps me if I have a list to go off of.  I'm a to-do list oriented person.  It also would help me to know which tasks are more important to get done right away and which tasks can wait, since I've struggled with prioritizing more important tasks in the past.

When the user chooses to display their to-do list, the list is sorted by priority, with the highest priority tasks being listed first.  They are also marked with a number of exclamation points to determine how important a task is, where the number of exclamation points depicts how high of a priority a task is.
